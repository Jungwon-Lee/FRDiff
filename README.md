# FRDiff : Feature Reuse for Universal Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion Models [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03517)


## Overview 
In our work, we introduce an advanced acceleration technique that leverages the ___temporal redundancy___ inherent in diffusion models. Reusing feature maps with high temporal similarity opens up a new opportunity to save computation resources without compromising output quality. To realize the practical benefits of this intuition, we conduct an extensive analysis and propose a novel method, ___FRDiff___. ___FRDiff___ is designed to harness the advantages of both reduced NFE and feature reuse, achieving a Pareto frontier that balances fidelity and latency trade-offs in various generative tasks.
